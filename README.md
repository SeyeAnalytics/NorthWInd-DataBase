## Introduction

The Northwind Database is for a business entity that deals with edible goods. 

Download the DB and restore it to your Postgres software. 

You will find the DB and the schema diagram in the assessment folder on the drive. 

Using the Northwind Database and schema diagram, 

you have been given the responsibility to retrieve the following outputs from the DB.


## Business Task

1.	The company wants to reward its Sales Representatives staff only.

For this to happen, we would need to know the staff name,

the total amount of money the staff has handled during a customer

transaction and the department this staff belongs to.

(Remember, we want just the sales Rep staff).

Please, help the Finance department to generate a summary table

that shows the full name (last + first name combined),

the total amount of transaction, and the title of these employees.

Put this output in a view. 

2.	The board of directors are interested in seeing the volume of transactions

this business has made. Your mission: In the operation year, give a breakdown

of the total number of orders by year and by month.

3. The company is doing well in terms of revenue.

The directors are planning to expand their customer base in some countries.

Generate a ranked table from the customers table that displays the customer id,

company name, city, country, total quantity, and the ranked value.

This rank table should be partitioned by country.

4.	There have been some concerns with some of our suppliers.

The management would like to know the MVP(most valuable players)

suppliers and the ones that can be replaced.

Return a table that shows the name of the company,

the contactâ€™s name and the average quantity these companies have done for the company.
